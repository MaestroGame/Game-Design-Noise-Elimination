# Forked Spoon of OpenSB

Here's the list of improvements by priority:
* Continuous crafting after closing the menu
* Food stacking by condition, not by expiration timer
* FU machines working without player attention with Watcher
 * Without Watcher it should not be allowed, since it will surely lag the game to a crawl
* Fixing lag during chunk loading
* Fixing lag on tree farms
